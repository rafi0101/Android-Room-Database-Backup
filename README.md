## Getting started

Android-Room-Database-Backup library is pushed
to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/de.raphaelebner/roomdatabasebackup/1.1.0/versions)
.  
Add the dependency for `Android-Room-Database-Backup ` to your app-level `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
implementation 'de.raphaelebner:roomdatabasebackup:1.1.0'
```

**If the version makes any technical problems please feel free to contact me. I made some changes in
Gradle/Kotlin DSL and not sure if everything is working as excepted**

## Usage

- [Properties](#Properties)
- [Exit Codes](#Exit-Codes)
- [Example Activity (Kotlin and Java)](#example-activity-kotlin-and-java)
- [Example Fragment (Java and Kotlin)](#example-fragment-kotlin-and-java)

### Properties

**Required**

- Current context  
  **Attention**  
   Must be declared outside of an onClickListener before lifecycle state changes to started

  ```kotlin
  RoomBackup(this)
  ```

  - Instance of your room database

    ```kotlin
    .database(*YourDatabase*.getInstance(this))
    ```

e.g. [`YourDatabase.kt`](app/src/main/java/de/raphaelebner/roomdatabasebackup/sample/database/main/FruitDatabase.kt)

**Optional**

The following options are optional and the default options

- Enable logging, for debugging and some error messages

  ```kotlin
  .enableLogDebug(false)
  ```

- Set custom log tag

  ```kotlin
  .customLogTag("debug_RoomBackup")
  ```

- Enable and set maxFileCount

  - if file count of Backups > maxFileCount all old / the oldest backup file will be deleted
  - can be used with internal and external storage
  - default: infinity

  ```kotlin
  .maxFileCount(5)
  ```

- Encrypt your backup

  - Is encrypted with AES encryption
  - uses a random 15 digit long key with alphanumeric characters
  - this key is saved in [EncryptedSharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/security/crypto/EncryptedSharedPreferences)
  - backup name is default backup name + ".aes"

  ```kotlin
  .backupIsEncrypted(false)
  ```

- Encrypt your backup with your own password / key

  - This property is only working, if `.backupIsEncrypted(true)` is set
  - If you use the key to encrypt the backup, you will also need it to decrypt
  - Example: If you want to create an encrypted backup, export it and import it to another device. Then you need a custom key, else the backup is encrypted with a random key, and you can not decrypt it on a new device

  **Attention**  
   i do not assume any liability for the loss of your key

  ```kotlin
  .customEncryptPassword("YOUR_SECRET_PASSWORD")
  ```

- Save your backup to different storage

  - External
    - storage path: /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/_package_/files/backup/
    - This files will be deleted, if you uninstall your app
    - `RoomBackup.BACKUP_FILE_LOCATION_EXTERNAL`
  - Internal
    - Private, storage not accessible
    - This files will be deleted, if you uninstall your app
    - `RoomBackup.BACKUP_FILE_LOCATION_INTERNAL`
  - Custom Dialog (beta)
    - You can choose to save or restore where ever you want. A CreateDocument() or OpenDocument() Activity will be launched where you can choose the location
    - If your backup is encrypted I reccomend you using a custom encrption password else you can't
      restore your backup
    - `RoomBackup.BACKUP_FILE_LOCATION_CUSTOM_DIALOG`
  - Custom File (beta)

    - You can choose to save or restore to/from a custom File.
    - If your backup is encrypted I reccomend you using a custom encrption password else you can't restore your backup
    - Please use `backupLocationCustomFile(File)` to set a custom File
    - `RoomBackup.BACKUP_FILE_LOCATION_CUSTOM_FILE`

    **Attention**  
    For custom dialog and custom file I only verified the functionality for local storage. For thirt party storage please try and contact me if it is not working. I hope I can find a solution and fix it :)

  ```kotlin
  .backupLocation(RoomBackup.BACKUP_FILE_LOCATION_INTERNAL)
  ```

- Set a custom File to save/restore to/from  
  Only working if `backupLocation` is set to `BACKUP_FILE_LOCATION_CUSTOM_FILE`  
  You have to define a File withe Filename and extension

  ```kotlin
  .backupLocationCustomFile(backupLocationCustomFile: File)
  ```

- Set a custom dialog title, when showing list of available backups to restore (only for external or internal storage)

  ```kotlin
  .customRestoreDialogTitle("Choose file to restore")
  ```

- Set your custom name to the Backup files

  **Attention**\
  If a backup file with the same name already exists, it will be replaced  
  customBackupFileName should not contain file extension. File extension(s) will be added automatically  
  ".sqlite3" is the default file extension and for encrypted backups ".aes" will be added

  ```kotlin
  .customBackupFileName(*DatabaseName* + *currentTime* + ".sqlite3")
  ```

- Run some code, after backup / restore process is finished

  - success: Boolean (If backup / restore was successful = true)
  - message: String (message with simple hints, if backup / restore failed)

  ```kotlin
  .onCompleteListener { success, message, exitCode ->
  }
  ```

- Restart your Application. Can be implemented in the onCompleteListener, when "success == true"

  **Attention**\
  it does not always work reliably!\
  But you can use other methods.\
  Important is that all activities / fragments that are still open must be closed and reopened\
  Because the Database instance is a new one, and the old activities / fragments are trying to
  work with the old instance

  ```kotlin
  .restartApp(Intent(this@MainActivity, MainActivity::class.java))
  ```

### Exit Codes

Here are all exit codes for the onCompleteListener.  
They can be calles using `OnCompleteListener.$NAME$`
